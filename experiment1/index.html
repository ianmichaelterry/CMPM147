				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment? lllll</p>
				<p>We are trying to generate some mad-libs stlye generative text, while learning the workflow for assignment formatting and submission in this course.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I replaced the text that was given to us in the sample with new text. Instead of generating a bad quest, it generates a line of bad advice.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>I was not particularly excited on the possibilities for the product of this exerciese, thusly, I didn't want to spend very much time on this. However, I found myself genuinely entertained when I finally interacted with the basic text generator that I created. I had a couple HTML bugs, but chat GPT did a great job of telling me what I was doing wrong and how to fix them. </p>
